            <h2>4.Arrays</h2>
            <p>
                <br>In C++, an array is a data structure used to store a collection of elements of the same data type, arranged in contiguous memory locations. Arrays allow efficient storage and access of multiple values, especially when the number of elements is known in advance. Each element in an array can be accessed using an index, starting from 0 for the first element. For example, in the declaration int arr[5];, arr is an array that can hold five integer values.<br>
                
                <br>Arrays in C++ can be of any data type, including integers, floating-point numbers, characters, or even user-defined types like classes. <br>The size of an array must be defined at the time of its declaration, and it remains fixed throughout the program. <br>You can initialize an array with values at the time of declaration, such as int arr[3] = {1, 2, 3};.<br>
                
                <br>One of the main advantages of arrays is that they allow you to group related data together, making it easier to manage and manipulate. <br>Arrays can be one-dimensional, where all elements are in a single line, or multi-dimensional, where elements are stored in tables, grids, or matrices. <br>A two-dimensional array is defined like this: int matrix[3][4];, where 3 represents the number of rows and 4 represents the number of columns.<br>
                
               <br> Accessing array elements is done through indices. For example, to access the third element in the array arr, you would write arr[2]. This allows for fast access to any element by directly referencing its index, making arrays an efficient choice for situations requiring frequent access to data.<br>
                
               <br> Arrays are often used in conjunction with loops for operations like searching, sorting, and processing all elements.<br>In C++, arrays are often used for performance-critical applications, where the need for efficient memory usage and fast access to elements is paramount. <br>Arrays provide a simple, low-overhead solution to store and manage multiple items, and their straightforward syntax makes them easy to use for beginners.<br>
                
                <br>To sum up, arrays in C++ are a fundamental concept that allows for storing multiple elements of the same type.<br> They are highly efficient for indexing and iterating over data, but they require careful management of their size and bounds.<br> While arrays are a powerful tool, modern C++ programming often uses more flexible alternatives like std::vector when dynamic resizing is needed.<br> Proper understanding and use of arrays are essential for writing optimized and effective C++ code.<br></p>
