            <h2>2.Variables</h2>
            <p>
                <br>In C++, variables are used to store data values that can be manipulated during the execution of a program. Each variable must be declared with a specific data type, which determines the kind of data it can hold. Common data types in C++ include int for integers, float for floating-point numbers, double for double-precision floating-point numbers, and char for single characters. <br>
                
                <br>The declaration of a variable includes the data type, variable name, and optionally, an initial value. For example, int age = 25; declares a variable named age of type int and initializes it with the value 25. Variable names must follow certain rules, such as starting with a letter or underscore and containing only letters, digits, and underscores. <br><br>
                
                <br>Variables can be classified into different types based on their scope and lifetime. Local variables are declared inside functions and are accessible only within those functions. Global variables are declared outside functions and can be accessed from anywhere within the program. Static variables retain their value between function calls, even though they are defined inside a function.<br>
                
                <br>C++ also allows the use of constants, which are variables whose values cannot be changed once assigned. These are declared using the const keyword, such as const int maxAge = 100;. Constants are often used for values that should remain fixed throughout the program.<br>
                
               <br> In C++, variables can be initialized at the time of declaration or assigned values later in the code. For example, int score; score = 50; declares a variable score and assigns the value 50 in a separate statement.<br>
                
                <br>C++ also provides the ability to declare multiple variables of the same type on a single line, separated by commas. For example, int a = 10, b = 20, c = 30; declares three integer variables on one line.<br>
                
                <br>The data type of a variable determines what operations can be performed on it. For instance, mathematical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division can be performed on integer and floating-point variables. C++ supports type casting, which allows converting a variable from one data type to another, using explicit or implicit casting.<br>
                
                <br>In C++, variables can also be declared as pointers, which store memory addresses of other variables. A pointer is declared using the asterisk *, such as int *ptr;, and it can point to a variable of the corresponding type.<br>
                
                <br>C++ provides the concept of reference variables, which are essentially aliases for other variables. A reference is declared using an ampersand &, such as int &ref = a;, where ref becomes another name for the variable a.<br>
                
                <br>Efficient variable management is crucial in C++ programming. Choosing the correct data type for a variable ensures that the program uses memory efficiently and performs operations optimally. Proper initialization and understanding the scope of variables can help prevent bugs and improve code clarity.<br>
                
                <br>Overall, variables are fundamental building blocks of any C++ program, serving as containers for data and enabling the manipulation and processing of information throughout the program.<br></p>
