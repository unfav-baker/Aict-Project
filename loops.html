            </p>
           <br> In C++, loops are used to repeatedly execute a block of code as long as a specific condition is met. Loops are essential for tasks that require repetition, such as iterating through arrays, performing calculations, or handling user input. C++ supports three primary types of loops: for, while, and do-while.<br>
            
            <br>The for loop is the most commonly used loop when the number of iterations is known in advance. It has three parts: initialization, condition, and iteration.The while loop is used when the number of iterations is unknown and the loop should continue as long as a condition is true.<br> <br>The condition is checked before each iteration. The do-while loop is similar to the while loop, but the condition is checked after the loop executes, ensuring that the loop runs at least once.<br>Loops can be controlled using keywords like break and continue.<br> <br>The break statement immediately terminates the loop, while the continue statement skips the current iteration and moves to the next one.Nested loops are loops inside other loops.<br> <br>This is useful when working with multi-dimensional data structures like matrices.In summary, loops in C++ are essential tools for repetition, making it easier to handle repetitive tasks efficiently. They come in three main types—for, while, and do-while—each suited for different use cases.<br> <br>With control statements like break and continue, loops become even more flexible and powerful. Whether you are working with simple iterations or nested structures, loops are fundamental for writing effective C++ programs.<br></p>
